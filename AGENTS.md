# orbyn-engine

Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) before changing behaviour. Its rules are the contract; change it in the same commit as any change to them.

## Layout

- `crates/`: the Rust workspace. Each crate's README says what it owns.
- `migrations/`: Postgres schema, applied by `orbyn migrate`.
- `docker/`, `compose.yaml`: the image and the local stack.
- `docs/architecture.md`: the contract. Its rules change in the same commit as the code.

## Checks

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test --workspace
```

The Postgres tests are `#[ignore]`d, so that command skips them. CI runs `cargo test --workspace -- --include-ignored` against a Postgres service; run it the same way, with `DATABASE_URL` set (they read it) and a database made for the run, because a leftover one can hide a missing migration or a test that depends on old rows. `docker compose up -d postgres` starts a server locally; `docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U orbyn -d orbyn -c "CREATE DATABASE <name>"` makes the database, and `DATABASE_URL=postgres://orbyn@127.0.0.1/<name>` points the tests at it.

`cargo test -p orbyn-contracts` regenerates the TypeScript bindings in `crates/orbyn-contracts/bindings/` (ts-rs writes them as the tests run). Run it after any change to a wire type and commit the result; CI fails when the committed files differ.

## Designs

The UI follows the private repository `orbyn-dev/orbyn-designs`, the one source of truth: `artifacts/` holds the published designs, `artifacts.json` indexes them, and `briefs/` holds the design-match brief. Read it from a current clone (`git pull` first), never from a copy in a temp folder, and never edit `artifacts/` here.

- Match the designs exactly, in Light, Dark and Dim, including copy and motion. Take every value from the design source.
- A UI change cites the artifact version and frame ids it builds, or links the design pull request there.
- Anything not designed or not in the plan goes to the Orbyn Product UI/UX Designer before it is built. Never invent it.
- The repository is private, so a contributor without access gets the frames they need in their issue.
- Public files never link the private plan or the design artifact pages.

## Delivery

- Branch from `main` with a short purpose name: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/` or `refactor/`.
- Open a pull request for every change. Merge only when every required check is green on the current head. Never weaken a check or merge red. Use a merge commit.
- Pull request and issue titles use `type(scope): summary`, at most 72 characters, with a kind from CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Every pull request fills in the template's AI usage section from what actually ran. The PR check fails while it is empty.
- Commits and branch names carry no agent or tool attribution: no `Co-Authored-By` trailer for an assistant, no generated-by line, no model or tool name. The AI usage section is the one place for it.
- Windows, macOS and Linux are all supported. Never add a Unix-only path, shell or signal without its Windows branch.
- Never commit secrets, real user data or files from your own machine. The repository is public.

Shared engineering methods live in the outer Orbyn Engineering library workspace. Do not copy them into this repository.
