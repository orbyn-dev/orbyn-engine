//! The device sync engine. It does no IO: a host makes the HTTP calls, keeps the
//! [`Snapshot`] and passes in the wall clock, so the same code runs natively and
//! in the browser.
//!
//! Per zone the engine holds the zone keys, the change token, and a cache of
//! records (their merged [`Fields`] and the last server version seen).
//!
//! - **Outgoing.** [`Engine::stage`] merges an edit into the cache and marks the
//!   record dirty. [`Engine::build_upload`] seals up to 200 dirty records into
//!   one atomic upload with expected versions and an operation id; until the
//!   server answers it returns the same batch, so a retry is idempotent.
//!   [`Engine::upload_succeeded`] applies the new versions;
//!   [`Engine::upload_conflicted`] merges each server copy with
//!   `orbyn_sync::merge_remote` and leaves the records dirty for the next batch,
//!   so no local field is lost.
//! - **Incoming.** [`Engine::apply_changes`] opens and merges a page of
//!   changes, moves the token on and returns what changed. A record that does
//!   not open is quarantined, never blocking the zone.
//! - **Trust.** Devices are trusted only through approval signatures this
//!   device checks itself ([`Engine::verify_devices`]); keys go only to them and
//!   are taken only from them. A zone's key changes only through a rotation a
//!   trusted device signed.
//! - **Deletes** are signed by the deleting device and checked before a
//!   tombstone removes anything.
