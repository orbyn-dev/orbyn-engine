//! The transparency log's Merkle tree, as pure code with no IO: the RFC 9162 tree, its inclusion and
//! consistency proofs and their verifiers, and an append-only [`Accumulator`] that keeps a root
//! from `O(log n)` hashes.
//!
//! The proof builders work over a [`Subtrees`] source, so a database that stores subtree hashes can
//! serve them without loading the leaves; a slice of leaf hashes is the reference source. The
//! verifiers follow the RFC's iterative algorithms, not the recursive definitions the builders use,
//! so the two check each other.
//!
//! It runs on the key service and on devices (native and WebAssembly): a device verifies with the
//! very code the key service builds with. [`entry`] and [`head`] are what an entry and an unsigned
//! head are, as canonical bytes.
//!
//! [`map`] is the path-compressed sparse Merkle map that holds the key service's two maps (the
//! service-key map and the identity map): membership and non-membership proofs, their verifier,
//! and the update function a witness replays (an old path plus a new value gives the new root).
