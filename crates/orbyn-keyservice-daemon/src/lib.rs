//! The key service's internal API and the mutual TLS it is served over.
//!
//! The record server calls three endpoints, each over a connection whose client certificate chains
//! to the CA the service trusts, and each of which checks that certificate's name again (see
//! [`api`]). There is no endpoint that opens an envelope, derives a secret, returns a private key
//! or signs bytes a caller chose: the table of routes in [`api::routes`] is the whole surface, and
//! a test lists it.
//!
//! **Audit.** A certification and a retirement are each reported to an [`Audit`] sink after they
//! are committed, with the account's map key and the time (no keys). The default sink writes a
//! structured log line; the off-machine sink is its own later change.
