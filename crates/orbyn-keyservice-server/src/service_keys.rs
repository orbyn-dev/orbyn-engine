//! Accounts' service keys: create-or-get, read and retire, each with its log entry.
//!
//! A service key row and the log entry that certifies it are written in one transaction under the
//! write lock, so a key is never held without its certification in the log, and the log never
//! certifies a key the store does not hold. The wrapped private key is written here and is never
//! read back out: nothing in this module (and no call the service makes) opens, returns or
//! derives from it. Opening arrives with recovery, on its own endpoint.
