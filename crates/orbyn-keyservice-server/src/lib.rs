//! The key service's store: its own database, migrations and roles, the transparency log and the
//! two maps on Postgres, and building a head (without signing it).
//!
//! **Two roles.** [`migrate`] runs with an owner role, which owns the tables and the triggers, and
//! then grants a separate runtime role only what the service needs: `SELECT` and `INSERT` on the
//! append-only tables, `UPDATE` of `log_entries.included_in_head` and nothing else, no `DELETE`,
//! no `TRUNCATE`, no DDL. Triggers refuse the rest even for the owner. These rules guard against
//! a bug in the service, not against whoever owns the database: the guarantee against a dishonest
//! operator is a witness checking every head, which no database rule can replace.
//!
//! **The log.** [`LogStore`] appends entries (the canonical bytes in `orbyn-translog`) with
//! gapless sequence numbers and a hash chain per account, and keeps the complete subtrees of the
//! RFC 9162 tree so a root at any size costs O(log n) reads.
//!
//! **The maps.** [`MapStore`] keeps each map as immutable, content-addressed nodes; an update
//! writes new nodes along one path, so every old head's roots still have proofs.
//!
//! **Heads.** [`Store::build_head`] applies the pending entries to both maps and returns the
//! unsigned head; [`Store::commit_head`] stores it once it is signed, and marks the entries it
//! covers. A stored head is **published** once enough witnesses have cosigned it: the cosignatures
//! and the publication are rows of their own ([`Store::add_cosignature`], [`Store::publish_head`]).
