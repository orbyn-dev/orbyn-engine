//! What each email says, as designed (Orbyn Account Designs, the Emails group).
//!
//! Every message is sent as HTML and plain text together, and every string here is copied from
//! those designs: the subject says the one purpose, the first line repeats it, and the only button
//! does it. The HTML is one column 560px wide in system fonts, with no images, no tracking and no
//! background colour (only text colour on the client's own background, plus one filled button),
//! so it reads in dark mode. Times are in UTC and say so. A link carries its token after `#`.
//!
//! A message's one value, [`super::Mail::code`], is the verification code for a code email, and
//! `<time as RFC 3339>\n<link or empty>` for the other two: the attempt time and the sign-in link,
//! or the deletion time and the cancel link. For the unused-account email it is the link alone,
//! empty when there is none. It travels only in the sealed queue entry.
