//! Outgoing email: what is sent, how it waits in the job queue, and how one delivery is decided.
//!
//! - A message is a [`Mail`]: its kind, the account it is about, the address and, for a
//!   verification, the code. Its address and code never appear in a log, in an error or in the
//!   `jobs` table: the queue entry carries them sealed (under a key derived from
//!   `ORBYN_AUTH_SETUP`), and only the kind and account in the clear.
//! - [`deliver`] takes one queued job and a [`Sender`] and says what happened: sent, try again
//!   later, or give up. Retrying uses the queue's backoff; a message still unsent 24 hours after it
//!   was queued is given up on, because a verification code is long dead by then.
//! - The SMTP sender lives in `orbyn-worker`. [`LogOnly`] is what the worker uses with no SMTP
//!   configured, and [`Capture`] is what tests use to read what would have been sent.
