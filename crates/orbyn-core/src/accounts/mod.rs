//! Accounts, sessions and trusted devices.
//!
//! - Sign-up and sign-in use OPAQUE (RFC 9807): the server never sees a password
//!   and keeps only the registration record. An unknown email gets a fake
//!   answer built from the server setup, so the answer does not tell whether an
//!   account exists.
//! - The server's half of a sign-in is sealed and kept in Postgres for five
//!   minutes, so any replica can finish it.
//! - A session token is 32 random bytes shown once; only its SHA-256 digest is
//!   stored. It lasts 30 days from its last use and at most one year.
//! - The first device is trusted at sign-up. A device that signs in later is
//!   pending until a trusted device signs its keys and the person types the
//!   six-digit code from the trusted device on it.
//!
//! Every operation checks its own authorization against the database; a route
//! only parses and maps.
