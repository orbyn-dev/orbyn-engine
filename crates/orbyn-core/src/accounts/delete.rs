//! Deleting an account: asked for with a signature, done seven days later, cancellable until then.
//!
//! - **Schedule.** Only a trusted device can ask, signing the request with its own key
//!   (`orbyn/account-delete/v1` over the account id, the device id and the time), from a session
//!   that finished its sign-in in the last ten minutes. A bearer token alone is
//!   `device_proof_required`; a stale session is `reauthentication_required`. When the account has
//!   a second factor, a current code or an unused recovery code is needed as well, checked as a
//!   sign-in checks it. Each signature is accepted once. The answer is the time of the deletion.
//!   One email goes out per schedule, 3 schedules an account a day; asking again while one is
//!   pending answers the same time and neither restarts the clock nor sends another email.
//! - **Grace period.** The account works as usual (the person can still export). Changes that could
//!   lock the owner out (removing a device, rotating a zone key, turning the second factor off)
//!   are refused with `deletion_scheduled` until the deletion is cancelled.
//! - **Cancel.** Any trusted device cancels with its signature (`orbyn/account-delete-cancel/v1`).
//!   So can a device that is still pending, if its session finished a sign-in (password and second
//!   factor) in the last ten minutes: someone locked out of every device can still cancel.
//! - **Cancel by mail.** The schedule email carries a link with a single-use token (32 random bytes,
//!   kept only as a keyed digest, valid until the deletion). It needs no sign-in and does nothing
//!   but cancel, so a thief holding every signed-in device cannot keep the owner from cancelling.
//!   A repeat request leaves the token alone; a cancel or the deletion ends it; a new schedule
//!   after a cancel makes a new token and sends a new email.
//! - **Delete.** The worker takes each due account under its row lock, reads the schedule again and,
//!   if it is still set and due, deletes everything in one transaction: the account row and its
//!   cascades (devices, sessions, key envelopes, zones, records, second factor, approvals), the
//!   queued jobs and pending sign-ups that name it, and the rate-limit rows keyed by it. What stays
//!   is the audit log, with no id, address digest or link left on any row: a random value, made for
//!   this deletion and kept nowhere else, only tells its rows apart.
