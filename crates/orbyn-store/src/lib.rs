//! The record store, modelled on CloudKit's private database.
//!
//! - An account owns zones (one per list, project or calendar), named by the
//!   client. A zone holds records: an id, a type, a version, and bytes the
//!   server never reads (the ciphertext and the wrapped record key).
//! - Each zone has a sequence. Every write takes the next value while the zone
//!   row is locked, so writes commit in sequence order. A record's version is the
//!   sequence of the write that produced it, and a change token is a sequence.
//! - An upload is atomic: if any record's version differs from the one the
//!   client expected, nothing is written and every conflicting record comes back.
//!   A client operation id makes a retried upload return its first result.
//! - A committed change is announced with `pg_notify`, which Postgres delivers
//!   only on commit and to every replica, and enqueues a `zone_changed` job when
//!   another device subscribed to the zone.
//! - The keychain keeps zone keys that one trusted device sealed to another
//!   trusted device of the account, as envelopes the server never opens.
//!
//! - The protection level is a chain of settings signed by trusted devices. The
//!   server checks each new one against the head and stores the chain; devices
//!   verify the signatures themselves.
//!
//! Every operation checks in the database that the session's account owns the
//! zone and that its device is trusted, not only the route.
