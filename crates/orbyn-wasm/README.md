# orbyn-wasm

JavaScript bindings, made with wasm-bindgen (MIT OR Apache-2.0), for the device crates: sign-in (`orbyn-auth-client`), device keys (`orbyn-crypto`) and the sync engine (`orbyn-client`). Data goes in and out as JSON in the `orbyn-contracts` wire shapes (their TypeScript is in `crates/orbyn-contracts/bindings`), and bytes as `Uint8Array`. A failure throws an `Error` whose message starts with a stable code, such as `missing_zone_key: ...`.

The crate also builds natively, so its tests run with `cargo test`. The JavaScript package itself is not built or tested in CI yet (that needs the `wasm-bindgen` CLI and a JavaScript runtime); CI only checks that the crate compiles for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

## Secrets stay inside WebAssembly

No function returns device keys, zone keys or the OPAQUE export key. What the host stores, the device keys and the engine snapshot, comes out sealed (XChaCha20-Poly1305) under a key derived inside WebAssembly with HKDF-SHA256 from a *wrapping secret* the host passes in.

The host gets the wrapping secret from a WebCrypto key that cannot be exported:

```js
// Once per device: a non-extractable HMAC key, kept in IndexedDB (structured
// clone keeps it non-extractable).
const wrapKey = await crypto.subtle.generateKey(
  { name: "HMAC", hash: "SHA-256" }, false, ["sign"]);

// Each launch: the wrapping secret is the key's MAC over a fixed label.
const label = new TextEncoder().encode("orbyn/local-wrap/v1");
const wrapSecret = new Uint8Array(await crypto.subtle.sign("HMAC", wrapKey, label));

const sealedKeys = keys.export(wrapSecret);           // store this
const keys2 = DeviceKeys.import(sealedKeys, wrapSecret);
const sealedState = engine.snapshot(wrapSecret);      // store this
const engine2 = SyncEngine.restore(keys2, sealedState, wrapSecret, Date.now());
wrapSecret.fill(0);
```

The functions that take the wrapping secret or the password (`export`, `import`, `snapshot`, `restore`, `startRegistration`, `finishRegistration`, `startLogin`, `finishLogin`) take them as owned buffers (`Vec<u8>` in Rust), which WebAssembly zeroes when the call ends, on every path including errors. A borrowed `&[u8]` would be copied into WebAssembly memory by the generated glue and freed without being zeroed. The `fill(0)` above clears only the JavaScript copy. Not covered: buffers inside `opaque-ke`, `argon2` and the hash functions while they run, which this crate does not own; a check that freed blocks held no copy of the password or secret found none on the error paths it exercised, but a full OPAQUE exchange was not part of it.

Why this and not AES-GCM through `crypto.subtle.encrypt` inside WebAssembly: it keeps every call synchronous and testable natively, and needs no `web-sys` or futures. The trade-off: the 32-byte wrapping secret is in JavaScript memory while it is used. Script running in the page could compute it anyway with the non-extractable key, so it reveals nothing that key does not; what it never sees is a device key or zone key. The snapshot is also bound to the device's public signing key, so one device's snapshot does not open with another's keys.

## Building for the web

Nothing in CI builds the JavaScript package yet; CI only runs `cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`. To build it by hand, install the `wasm-bindgen` CLI at the same version as the `wasm-bindgen` crate in `Cargo.lock` (the two must match), then:

```bash
cargo build -p orbyn-wasm --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
wasm-bindgen --target web --out-dir pkg \
  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/orbyn_wasm.wasm
```

`pkg/` then holds `orbyn_wasm.js`, its `.d.ts` and the `.wasm` file. `.cargo/config.toml` already sets the `getrandom` backend for the browser. Optionally shrink the module with `wasm-opt -Oz`.

## The planner's `AuthCrypto` interface

| `AuthCrypto` | This crate | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `startRegistration(password)` | `startRegistration(password: Uint8Array): PendingRegistration` | `.request` is `RegisterStart.registration_request` |
| `finishRegistration(...)` | `finishRegistration(pending, password, response): Uint8Array` | Returns `RegisterFinish.registration_upload`; works once |
| `startLogin(password)` | `startLogin(password: Uint8Array): PendingLogin` | `.request` is `LoginStart.credential_request` |
| `finishLogin(...)` | `finishLogin(pending, password, response): Uint8Array` | Returns `LoginFinish.credential_finalization`; a wrong password throws `auth_failed` |
| device keys: create | `DeviceKeys.create()` | |
| device keys: export | `keys.export(wrapSecret): Uint8Array` | Sealed; see above |
| device keys: import | `DeviceKeys.import(sealed, wrapSecret)` | |
| public keys | `keys.signingKey()`, `keys.agreementKey()` | Base64url, as `NewDevice` wants them |
| `sign(context, message)` | `keys.sign(context, message): Uint8Array` | Any context; prefer the helpers below |
| sign-up signature | `keys.signRegistration(email, upload)` | `register_message` under `orbyn/device-register/v1`; normalises the email |
| sign-in signature | `keys.signLogin(loginId)` | `login_message` under `orbyn/device-login/v1`; `loginId` is the UUID from `LoginStarted` |
| trusted start proof | `keys.signTrustedStart(email, credentialRequest, signedAt)` | `trusted_start_message`; `signedAt` in Unix seconds |
| email | `normalizeEmail(email): string \| undefined` | |

The OPAQUE export key never leaves WebAssembly: it is wiped when `finishRegistration` or `finishLogin` returns. It will be used inside the module when Advanced protection needs it.

## Approving a device

Both screens show the same six digits; the person confirms on each. The protocol and its exact message order are in `docs/architecture.md` (Accounts and devices). The calls, in order:

| Step | Approver (trusted device) | New device |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `s = engine.startApproval(pendingDeviceJson, nowSecs)`; send `s.createJson` to `POST /v1/devices/approvals` | |
| 2 | | read `GET /v1/devices/current`; `d = engine.joinApproval(approvalJson, nowSecs)`; send `d.nonceJson` to `…/{id}/nonce` |
| 3 | read `GET /v1/devices/approvals/{id}`; send `s.reveal(approvalJson)` to `…/{id}/reveal` | |
| 4 | show `s.sas()` and `s.deviceFingerprint()`; only on "They match": send `engine.confirmApproval(s, deviceListJson)` to `…/{id}/confirm` | read `GET /v1/devices/current`; show `d.sas(approvalJson)` |
| 5 | | only on "They match": `code = engine.finishApproval(d, approvalJson, typedOrUndefined, nowSecs)`; send `{code}` to `…/{id}/code` |

On "They don't match" either device sends `…/{id}/cancel`. Each session works once; a new attempt needs a new approval. `finishApproval` refuses until the approver has confirmed, so poll `GET /v1/devices/current` until `signature` is set.

Protection level: `engine.signProtection('standard' | 'advanced', nowSecs)` gives the body of `POST /v1/keychain/protection`, the next link of the chain this device verified. After any change, and on start, fetch `GET /v1/keychain/protection?from=` with `engine.protectionFrom()` (the verified head, or for a device just approved the sequence its approver vouched for), page by page while `more`, and give each answer, with the device list, to `engine.verifyProtection(chainJson, devicesJson)`; it returns `{seq, state, level, stopped}`, moves the verified head forward over every link a trusted device signed or committed to, and throws `protection_rollback` or `protection_fork` without changing anything. `engine.protectionLevel()` is `{state, level}`: `verified` (the whole chain was walked to the server's head, from an anchor this device trusts, and nothing stopped it: the only state in which Standard may be acted on), `provisional` (a guess: show it, never act on it; `stopped` says why a walk stopped) or `unknown` (no level, not Standard). To move the chain past a link this device could not verify, show the person the setting and, only if they confirm, send `engine.resignProtection(level, serverHeadLinkJson, nowSecs)` as the same `POST`. On a 409 `protection_conflict`, fetch, verify and sign again; a head that is the setting you sent means it went through.

Removing a device: send `engine.signRemoval(deviceJson)` as the body of `DELETE /v1/devices/{id}`. Deleting a zone: send `engine.deleteZoneProof(zone)` as the body of `DELETE /v1/zones/{zone}`.

## Losing local data

Clearing the site's data (or the browser's storage for it) deletes the sealed device keys, the snapshot and the wrapping key, and none of them can be recovered: the server never had them. If the person has another trusted device, sign in again as a new device, approve it from that device and let it share the zone keys again; the records come back from the server. If this was the person's only device, its encrypted data is lost for good until Standard or Advanced protection (with recovery) exists.

## Sync engine

`SyncEngine.create(keys, accountId, deviceId)` (from `SessionCreated`) or `SyncEngine.restore(keys, sealed, wrapSecret, nowMillis)`, then:

- `snapshot(wrapSecret)`: the sealed state to store.
- `tick(now)`: a `Stamp` for a new edit. `tickAt(editAt, now)`: a `Stamp` for an edit made at `editAt`, which may be earlier than `now` (queued while the app was closed). It is never earlier than the last stamp this device issued or saw (an older `editAt` is moved just after it), and an `editAt` after `now` is taken as `now`, silently: an edit cannot be in the future, and a stamp ahead of the clock would be dropped by other devices. `restore` no longer moves the clock to its own `now`, so a later `tickAt` can use the edit's own time; it keeps a record whose newest stamp is more than an hour ahead of `now` but does not let it move the clock, and `skippedFutureStamps()` says how many there were: log a non-zero count. `stage(zone, recordType, id, fieldsJson)`, `stageItem(zone, itemJson, beforeJson?, now)`, `delete(zone, id)`.
- `record(zone, id)`: `{"record_type": ..., "fields": Fields}` (this was the bare `Fields` before), `item(zone, id)`, `token(zone)`.
- `quarantined(zone)`: `[{"record_id": ..., "reason": ...}]` for the records waiting for a key, with the reason `missing_zone_key`, `open_failed` or `invalid_record`; never their bytes.
- `buildUpload(zone)`: an `UploadChanges` (the same batch until answered), then `uploadSucceeded(zone, uploadResultJson)`, `uploadConflicted(zone, recordChangedJson, now)` or `abandonUpload(zone)`.
- `applyChanges(zone, zoneChangesJson, now)` (and `applyChangesFrom(zone, since, zoneChangesJson, now)`, required while a zone is refetched after `tokenExpired`): returns `{changed, removed, trashed, quarantined, unverified_deletes, rejected, more}`.
- `retryQuarantined(zone, now)` after new keys arrive; `trash(zone)` and `takeFromTrash(zone, id)`.
- `checkZones(zoneListJson)`: returns `{stale, next}`; follow `next` as `?after=`.
- Devices and keys: `verifyDevices(deviceListJson)` (the ids this device trusts: its approver, the devices that approver endorsed, and their approval chains, minus signed removals), `pinDevice(id, signingKey, agreementKey)`, `createZoneKey(zone)`, `rotateZoneKey(zone)`, `envelopesFor(zone, deviceListJson, serviceCertJson?)` (a `PutKeyEnvelopes`, only to verified devices; with a verified `ServiceKeyCertification`, `service_envelopes` also seals every key of the zone to the account's service key), `acceptEnvelopes(keyEnvelopeListJson, deviceListJson)`, `serviceEnvelopesFor(zone, serviceCertJson)` (the `NewServiceEnvelope[]` for the pairs `GET /v1/keychain/service-missing` lists), `verifyServiceKey(inputJson)` (the service-key check, below).
- `itemToFields(itemJson, beforeJson?, stampJson)` and `itemFromFields(id, fieldsJson)`.

## Service key check

`verifyServiceKey(inputJson)` checks the account's service key against the transparency log, for a host that fetched the answers from the key service's public API (never through the record server). It keeps nothing itself: store `verified.public_key` and `verified.seen` and pass them back next time.

```js
const out = JSON.parse(verifyServiceKey(JSON.stringify({
  pins: {
    log_keys: [{ version: 1, key: "…" }],       // base64url, 32 bytes
    witnesses: ["…", "…"],                       // base64url, 32 bytes
    threshold: 2,                                // more than half of the witnesses
    identity_keys: [{ version: 1, key: "…" }],   // base64url, 32 bytes
  },
  account_id: "…",                               // the account's UUID
  offered: certification,                        // ServiceKeyCertification from GET /v1/keychain/service-key
  answers: {
    lookup: "…",                                 // GET /v1/log/lookup/{service public key}
    entry_pages: ["…"],                          // GET /v1/log/entries?service_public_key=…
    consistency: null,                           // GET /v1/log/consistency once the log grew
  },
  known_key: storedServiceKey ?? null,           // base64url, 33 bytes; null the first time
  seen: storedSeen ?? null,                      // verified.seen from the last check
  now: Date.now(),                               // milliseconds
}));
```

`out.verified` holds `{identity_version, public_key, statement_hash, entry_index, seen}`, and only then may the device escrow: `envelopesFor(zone, devices, certification)` or `serviceEnvelopesFor(zone, certification)`. `out.refusal` holds `{code, takeover, message}`:

- `takeover: true`: the account's key or the log is wrong, so show a possible-takeover warning. `key_changed` is a different key for the account than the one already verified; the rest are log verdicts (`log_fork`, `log_rollback`, `bad_identity_signature`, `offered_not_newest`, …).
- `takeover: false`: not a verdict about the account. `clock_ahead` asks the person to check the device's clock; `needs_consistency` fetches the consistency proof and asks again; `heads_differ`, `too_many_pages` and `malformed` mean the answers were wrong or incomplete, so fetch them again.

A failed fetch, or a 503 `no_published_head` from `GET /v1/keychain/service-key`, is availability: do not call this and send no envelopes yet. Handing `envelopesFor` or `serviceEnvelopesFor` a certification whose statement hash is not of this account and key throws `service_key_mismatch`.
